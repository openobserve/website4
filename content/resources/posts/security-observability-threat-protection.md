<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security observability is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data from various parts of your IT infrastructure to gain insights into security-related events. This holistic approach goes beyond simple monitoring; it offers deep visibility into system operations and user activities, making identifying anomalies and potential threats easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By combining observability and security, you create a robust framework for proactive threat detection and response, ultimately protecting your organization from evolving cyber threats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next section, we'll discuss the critical role of Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) in evaluating the effectiveness of these security practices.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Importance of Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) in Cybersecurity</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) is a crucial metric in cybersecurity that measures the effectiveness of an organization's threat detection and response practices.
