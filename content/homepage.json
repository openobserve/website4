        "desc": "OpenObserve is an innovative open-source observability platform designed to streamline the monitoring of logs, metrics, and traces. Thanks to its compatibility with storage services such as S3, GCS, Minio, and Azure Blob, OpenObserve significantly lowers storage costs - reducing them to about 140 times less than Elasticsearch. Our platform stands out due to its stateless nodes architecture, a feature that ensures hassle-free scaling. Its GUI is not only user-friendly but also advanced, facilitating the management of various systems and various types of observability data. Think of it as an amalgamation of Prometheus for metrics, Elasticsearch for logs, Jaeger for traces, and Grafana for dashboards, all in one place. OpenObserve eliminates the need to master a new query language by supporting SQL as its primary query language. Additionally, we support PromQL for querying metrics data, extending its versatility. One of the standout features of OpenObserve is its built-in alerting mechanism. This enables users to dispatch alerts to any platform, including but not limited to Slack and Teams. All this is wrapped in a package developed in Rust, ensuring high performance and memory safety. Join us at OpenObserve, where efficiency meets cost-effectiveness.",
