Are you looking to optimize your MySQL database monitoring without juggling multiple tools? In this blog post, we’ll guide you through leveraging OpenTelemetry and OpenObserve to effectively monitor MySQL metrics. By utilizing the **MySQL receiver** of the OpenTelemetry Collector, you can scrape metrics seamlessly and push them to OpenObserve that will allow us to capture the metrics, build dashboards and generate alerts.

## Understanding MySQL: A Brief Overview

MySQL is one of the most popular **relational database management systems (RDBMS)** in the world, renowned for its reliability, flexibility, and ease of use. It supports a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise solutions. MySQL is particularly favored for:

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data remains accurate and consistent.
- **Scalability:** Can handle large volumes of data and high transaction rates.
- **Community Support:** A vast ecosystem of tools and libraries enhances its capabilities.

Given its widespread usage, monitoring MySQL performance is crucial for maintaining application health and ensuring optimal user experiences.


## Why Metrics Monitoring is Essential for MySQL

Effective metrics monitoring is vital for maintaining the performance and reliability of your MySQL database. By keeping an eye on various performance indicators, you can proactively identify potential issues before they escalate. Here are key areas where monitoring can make a significant difference:

- **Query Performance:** Understanding query response times and identifying slow or long-running queries helps in optimizing database interactions.
- **Throughput Measurement:** Metrics like queries per second and transactions per second provide insights into the database's workload and efficiency.
- **Resource Utilization:** Monitoring CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O ensures that your database operates within its resource limits, preventing bottlenecks.
- **Connection Management:** Keeping track of max connections, active threads, and failed connections helps manage load and avoid denial-of-service conditions.
- **Replication Health:** Monitoring replication latency and errors is crucial for maintaining data consistency across distributed systems.
- **Database Growth:** Understanding the growth rate of your database and tracking InnoDB row operations helps in planning for future capacity needs.
- **Error Detection:** Monitoring for configuration and operational errors can prevent downtime and data loss.

In summary, a comprehensive metrics monitoring strategy allows you to make informed decisions, optimize performance, and maintain a healthy database environment.

## How Do We Monitor MySQL Metrics?

We will use Otel-Collector mysql receiver to collect metrics and push them to OpenObserve that will allow us to capture the metrics, build dashboards and generate alerts.

## MySQL Reciever

The MySQL receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to query **MySQL’s global status** and **InnoDB tables**. It utilizes the `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS` command to collect a wealth of metrics that provide insights into the database's performance and health.

Here’s a sample configuration for the MySQL receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  mysql:
    endpoint: localhost:3306
    username: otel
    password: ${env:MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    database: otel
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s
```
In this configuration:

- **endpoint:** Specifies the MySQL server's hostname and port.
- **username/password:** Credentials for authentication.
- **database:** The target database; if omitted, metrics are collected for all databases.
- **collection_interval:** Defines how frequently metrics are collected.

## Key Metrics Collected by the MySQL Receiver

The MySQL receiver collects a variety of metrics that provide insights into database performance. Here are some key metrics emitted by default:

1. **mysql.uptime:** The number of seconds the server has been running.
2. **mysql.threads:** The state of MySQL threads (e.g., cached, connected, running).
3. **mysql.buffer_pool.data_pages:** The number of data pages in the InnoDB buffer pool.
4. **mysql.operations:** The number of InnoDB operations (e.g., reads, writes).
5. **mysql.locks:** The number of MySQL locks.

These metrics are crucial for assessing the performance and health of your MySQL instance.Find the complete list of default metrics [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/mysqlreceiver)

> Ensure your MySQL version is 8.0 or higher for compatibility with the receiver.

## Getting Started with MySQL Monitoring

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **A running MySQL instance:** Make sure your MySQL server is accessible.
- **Basic understanding of OpenTelemetry:** Familiarity with OpenTelemetry concepts will help you navigate the setup.
- **An operational OpenObserve instance:** Ensure you have OpenObserve installed and running to visualize your metrics.

### Step 1: Prepare Your MySQL Environment

Make sure your MySQL server is up and running. If you are running it locally, it should be accessible at `localhost:3306`.

You may want to create a dedicated user for OpenTelemetry monitoring:

```sql
CREATE USER 'otel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT SELECT, PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'otel'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

```

### Step 2: Install the OpenTelemetry Collector

Next, we need to install the OpenTelemetry Collector. 

> *NOTE: The default Otel Collector doesn't have all the receivers, including the Postgres one we are going to use to collect data from the DB. It has support for receivers like Kafka, Prometheus, Jaeger, etc. So, instead of using [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector), we are going to use [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).*

1. Visit the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib Releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases) page.

2. Download the latest release for your machine. You can use the following command in your terminal to download `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` for macOS , replacing `v0.115.1` with the latest version number:

 ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fOL https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.115.1/otelcol-contrib_0.115.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

3. Unzip the downloaded file:

```bash
   tar -xvf otelcol-contrib_0.115.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

4. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin):
```bash
sudo mv otelcol-contrib /usr/local/bin/
```
5. After installation, check the status of the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```bash
otelcol-contrib --version
```

### Step 3: Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector

Receivers in the OpenTelemetry Collector are responsible for collecting telemetry data from various sources. They act as the entry point for data into the collector, allowing it to gather metrics, logs, and traces from different systems. Each receiver is designed to handle specific types of data and protocols.


Next, you’ll need to create a configuration file named `config.yaml`. This file defines how the Collector will behave, including what data it will receive, how it will process that data, and where it will send it.


```yaml
receivers:
  mysql:
    endpoint: "localhost:3306"
    username: otel
    password: ${env:MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    database: otel
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 10000
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  otlphttp/openobserve:
    endpoint: http://localhost:5080/api/default
    headers:
      Authorization: Basic YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
      stream-name: default

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [mysql]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/openobserve]
```

#### Breakdown of the Configuration:

- **Receivers:** Collect metrics from your MySQL instance. Ensure the endpoint and credentials match your MySQL configuration.
  
- **Processors**: The `batch` processors help manage and optimize data flow to exporters.

- **Exporters**: The `otlphttp/openobserve` exporter sends the collected telemetry data to OpenObserve. Replace YOUR_API_ENDPOINT and YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN with your actual OpenObserve API endpoint and authentication token, which you can find in your **Data Sources** -> **Custom** - > **Metrics** -> **Otel Collector**

### Step 4: Run the OpenTelemetry Collector

To run the OpenTelemetry Collector with the specified configuration, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
otelcol-contrib --config /path/to/your/config.yaml
```
*Replace `/path/to/your/config.yaml` with the actual path to your configuration file.*

You should get a output similar to this
