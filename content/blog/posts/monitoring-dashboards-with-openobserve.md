## Getting Started: Setting Up OpenObserve

### Step 1: Installing OpenObserve

To get started with OpenObserve, you have several options for installation. Below are the most common methods:

1. **Using Docker (Recommended for Quick Setup):**
   If you have Docker installed on your machine, setting up OpenObserve is straightforward. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

 Docker images are available at [https://gallery.ecr.aws/zinclabs/openobserve](https://gallery.ecr.aws/zinclabs/openobserve)

   ```bash 
   docker run -v $PWD/data:/data -e ZO_DATA_DIR="/data" -p 5080:5080 \
    -e ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL="root@example.com" -e ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD="Complexpass#123" \public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/openobserve:latest
   ```
   *Replace `root@example.com` and `Complexpass#123` with your desired credentials.*

   Once the container is up and running, navigate to http://localhost:5080 and login in your web browser to access the OpenObserve UI.

2. **Self-Hosting Locally:**
- Download the latest OpenObserve binary from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve).
- Extract the zip file to a directory (e.g., C:\OpenObserve).
- Run `openobserve.exe`.

3. **Helm (for Kubernetes):**
- Run this commmand
```bash
helm repo add openobserve https://openobserve.github.io/helm-charts
helm install openobserve openobserve/openobserve
```

### Step 2: Loading Sample Data

Let's start by loading sample data into OpenObserve. This will allow you to quickly experience all the Dashboard features without needing to set up custom data sources, making it easy to dive into building and visualizing dashboards.

*Ensure you have curl installed on your system before running these commands.*

Use the following command to download real-life log data:
```bash
curl -L https://zinc-public-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/zinc-enl/sample-k8s-logs/k8slog_json.json.zip -o k8slog_json.json.zip
```

Unzip the downloaded file:
```bash
unzip k8slog_json.json.zip
```
*Note: Replace the URL you got from OpenObserve Cloud and append it with @k8slog_json.json*

For **OpenObserve Cloud**
```bash
curl -u user@domain.com:abqlg4b673465w46hR2905 -k https://api.openobserve.ai/api/User_organization_435345/default/_json -d "@k8slog_json.json"
```
For **Self-Hosted-Installation**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5080/api/default/default/_json -i -u "root@example.com:Complexpass#123"  -d "@k8slog_json.json"
```

2. Repeat the panel configuration steps as needed.

3.  Click **Apply** and preview.

* Note: OpenObserve offers 18 different chart types, each suited for a specific purpose. To create an effective dashboard, select the chart type that best fits your use case. For instance, use an Area Chart to show trends over time or a Bar Chart to compare categories.


#### **Config Panel**
For those who love customization, the **Config Panel** is your best friend! This powerful configuration tool ensures that every panel displays the data exactly how you need it.
- Adjust **legends** to enhance readability.
- Set **units** and **decimals** to control data precision.
- Configure **axis properties** to match your exact requirements.

![Config Panel Example](/img/blog/dashboard/image10.png)


#### **Auto Mode** for Panel Creation
**Auto Mode** is the easiest way to create panels. It allows you to:
- **Drag-and-Drop Fields**: Quickly add fields to your visualizations.
- **Apply Filters**: Easily filter your data using available values.
- ![auto](/img/blog/dashboard/image12.png)

Auto Mode is perfect for beginners or when you need quick insights without complex queries.

#### **Custom Query Mode**
Use **Custom Queries** for more control and flexibility. Here are some scenarios where Custom Query Mode is useful:
- ![auto](/img/blog/dashboard/image11.png)

- **Advanced Aggregations**: If you need specialized aggregations beyond basic counts or averages.
- **Complex Filters**: For advanced conditions like `AND`/`OR` combinations.
- **SQL Functions**: Use SQL functions for custom data manipulation. See the [documentation](https://openobserve.ai/docs/functions/) for a list of available functions.


#### **PromQL Queries** for Metrics
For **metrics**, OpenObserve supports **PromQL**. PromQL is a powerful tool for querying time-series data. Here are some examples:

- ![promql](/img/blog/dashboard/image17.png)
- **Instant Queries**: Get current values, e.g., `up{job="node-exporter"}`.
- **Range Queries**: Retrieve data over a specific time range, e.g., `rate(http_requests_total{job="web server"}[5m])`.
- **Aggregations and Filtering**: Perform operations like sum or filter metrics, e.g., `sum(cpu_usage{instance="example-server"})`.
- **Metric Operations**: Apply calculations, e.g., `rate(http_requests_total{job="web server"}[5m]) * 100`.

PromQL is ideal for detailed metrics analysis, giving you full control over your data.

*Tip:  **Auto Mode** works well for most use cases, while **Custom Queries** and **PromQL** provide more advanced options when needed.*

### Advanced Dashboard Features

#### **Dynamic Filtering with Variables**

When you build monitoring dashboards, dynamic filtering with variables can streamline your monitoring setup, reducing the need for multiple dashboards and improving load times.

**Practical Use Case: Multiple Kubernetes Namespaces**

When monitoring multiple Kubernetes namespaces, creating separate dashboards can be inefficient. Instead of creating a separate dashboard for each namespace, you can create a variable called **namespace**. This variable can then be used across all panels with a filter, such as `$namespace  `.

How It Works:

- Add the `namespace` variable to your panels.
- ![variable](/img/blog/dashboard/image1.png)

- Use it in your queries to filter the displayed data dynamically.
- ![query](/img/blog/dashboard/image9.png)

- With just one dashboard, you can select any Kubernetes namespace and instantly load its relevant data.
- ![namespacee](/img/blog/dashboard/image7.png)


#### **Save and Export**

 Once you've arranged all the panels to your satisfaction, click **Save Dashboard**.

**Export**: Click **Export** to save the dashboard as a **JSON file** for sharing or backup purposes.
- ![Export Dashboard](/img/blog/dashboard/image14.png)


**Share**: Copy and share the link with colleagues.

- ![Share Dashboard](/img/blog/dashboard/image8.png)


*Note: Create tabs for CPU, Memory if you want to add additional related metrics without cluttering the main view.*
