Aerospike is a high-performance, distributed database known for its low-latency and scalability. It is widely used in industries requiring real-time data processing, such as advertising technology, financial services, and telecommunications. Monitoring Aerospike with OpenTelemetry helps ensure optimal performance and provides actionable insights into database operations.

This guide covers the installation of Aerospike on Ubuntu, setting up the OpenTelemetry Collector with the Aerospike receiver, and sending metrics to OpenObserve for observability.

## Why Aerospike?

Aerospike is designed to handle high-throughput workloads with minimal latency. Key benefits include:

1. **Low Latency:** Aerospikeâ€™s in-memory architecture ensures rapid access to data.  
2. **High Scalability:** Ideal for applications that need to scale horizontally with ease.  
3. **Strong Consistency:** Aerospike ensures data consistency even in distributed environments.  
4. **Ease of Deployment:** With native clustering, Aerospike simplifies database management.

By monitoring Aerospike with OpenTelemetry, you can:

* Detect performance bottlenecks.  
* Gain insights into resource usage.  
* Monitor database health and metrics in real time.

## Installation of Aerospike on Ubuntu

Follow these steps to install Aerospike on Ubuntu:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

```
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.0g-2ubuntu4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.0g-2ubuntu4_amd64.deb
```

2. **Download Aerospike Package:**

```
wget -O aerospike.tgz https://download.aerospike.com/artifacts/aerospike-server-community/6.2.0.0/aerospike-server-community_6.2.0.0_tools-8.0.2_ubuntu20.04_x86_64.tgz
```

3. **Extract the Package:**

```
tar -xvf aerospike.tgz
cd aerospike-server-community_6.2.0.0_tools-8.0.2_ubuntu20.04_x86_64/
```

4. **Install Aerospike:**

```
sudo ./asinstall
```

5. **Start Aerospike Service:**

```
systemctl start aerospike
```

6. **Verify Installation:** Check the Aerospike service status:

```
systemctl status aerospike
```

## Installation of OpenTelemetry Collector (Contrib)

1. **Install OpenTelemetry Collector:** Follow steps 1 and 2 from [this guide](https://openobserve.ai/blog/how-to-monitor-zookeeper-with-openteletemtry#step-2-configuring-opentelemetry-contrib-receiver-for-zookeeper).

2. **Configure the Aerospike Receiver:** Update the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file:

![aerospike dashboard](/img/blog/aerospike-monitoring/data_source.jpeg)

```
receivers:
  aerospike:
    endpoint: "localhost:3000"
exporters:
  otlphttp/openobserve:
    endpoint: OPENOBSERVE_ENDPOINT
    headers:
      Authorization: OPENOBSERVE_TOKEN
      stream-name: OPENOBSERVE_STREAM
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [aerospike]
      exporters: [otlphttp/openobserve]
```

3. **Replace**:

   * `OPENOBSERVE_ENDPOINT` with your OpenObserve endpoint (e.g., `http://openobserve.example.com/api/org`).  
   * `OPENOBSERVE_TOKEN` with your OpenObserve authentication token.  
   * `OPENOBSERVE_STREAM` with your desired stream name.  
4. **Restart OpenTelemetry Collector:**

```
systemctl restart otel-collector
```

## Configuring Dashboards in OpenObserve

1. **Verify Metrics in OpenObserve:** Navigate to your OpenObserve dashboard to confirm the receipt of metrics from Aerospike.
