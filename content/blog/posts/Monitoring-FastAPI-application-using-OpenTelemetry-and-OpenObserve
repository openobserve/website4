## Introduction to OpenTelemetry & OpenObserve

*OpenTelemetry and OpenObserve? Game changers in the observability landscape!*

OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework, allows developers to collect logs, metrics, and traces in a standardized way. OpenObserve steps in as the perfect partner, offering a user-friendly interface to analyze this telemetry data effectively. It’s like having a magnifying glass to scrutinize the inner workings of your application.

**Logging in OpenTelemetry**

*Logging is not just about recording events; it’s about gaining insights.*

OpenTelemetry simplifies logging by integrating with existing logging libraries. This unified approach lets you capture logs, traces, and metrics with consistent metadata, making it easier to correlate data across your application. Imagine tracing a single request from start to finish across various services—that’s the power of OpenTelemetry.

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
import logging
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer_provider().get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("demo"):

  current_span = trace.get_current_span()
  current_span.add_event("This is a span event")
  logging.getLogger().error("This is a log message")
```


Collecting telemetry data is only the first step - the real value lies in the ability to effectively analyze and derive insights from this data. This is where OpenObserve steps in as a powerful solution. 

#### OpenObserve Key Features

- **Easy to deploy & Lightweight**: Single binary that can run on a laptop or as a container/Kubernetes cluster

## Collecting Logs with OpenTelemetry

*Unified data collection with OpenTelemetry? Yes, please!*

OpenTelemetry is a versatile tool that allows you to collect logs either directly or via existing log files. You can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to process these logs and export them to a platform like OpenObserve. This setup ensures that your logs, traces, and metrics are seamlessly integrated, providing a holistic view of your application.

*Demo Architecture* 

## Getting Started

For this demo, we will perform all the tasks in a Windows environment. You can also do these in other environment(ubuntu/Mac).

### Step 1: Setting Up the OpenTelemetry Collector

First things first, let’s set up the OpenTelemetry Collector:

1.  Run the commands below to install the opentelemetry-collector-contrib for Windows. Make sure you check that you are using the latest version.

```bash
cd .\otel-collector\

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.107.0/otelcol-contrib_0.107.0_windows_amd64.tar.gz" -OutFile "otelcol-contrib.tar.gz"

tar -xzf otelcol-contrib.tar.gz
```

### Step 2: Configuring OpenTelemetry Collector

Next, we need to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector using a `config.yaml` file. This file defines how logs are received, processed, and exported. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- Receivers:
  - `filelog`: Monitors your application log file.
  - `otlp`: Supports gRPC and HTTP protocols for receiving traces.
- Processors:
  - `batch`: Batches log entries for efficient transmission.
- Exporters:
    - `otlphttp/openobserve`: Sends all telemetry data to OpenObserve. To set this up, 
      log in to OpenObserve, click on the `Ingestion` button from the sidebar, and 
      select `Custom` and then `Otel Collector` to get the endpoint and the token.

#### `config.yaml`

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: path\to\the\file\app.log
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlphttp/openobserve:
    endpoint: `http://localhost:5080/api/default/`
    headers:
      Authorization: Basic cm9vdEBleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpNM3FCR2tvaFhGNjBjOXFM
      stream-name: default

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/openobserve]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/openobserve]
```

Run this command below in the directory in which opentelemetry-collector-contrib was installed to run the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config "path/to/file\config.yaml"
```
You will get an output similar to the screenshot below:

![image](\img\blog\Fast-api\image4.png)

The collector is now up and running, ready to process logs and traces like a pro.


### Step 3: Setting Up OpenObserve
Now, let's get OpenObserve running:

1. Download and Set Up OpenObserve, Make sure you check that you are using the latest version::

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/releases/download/v0.10.7/openobserve-v0.11.0-windows-amd64.zip" -OutFile "openobserve.zip"

Expand-Archive -Path openobserve.zip -DestinationPath .
```
2. Run OpenObserve:

```bash
$env:ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL = "root@example.com"
$env:ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD = "Complexpass#123"
.\openobserve.exe
```

Boom! OpenObserve is live at http://localhost:5080. Time to dive into some data!

### Step 4: Setting Up the FastAPI Application
Next, we set up a FastAPI application that logs all requests:

#### `main.py`
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
import logging

resource = Resource(attributes={"service.name": "fastapi-service"})
tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Set up OTLP exporter for traces
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317", insecure=True)
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',
    filemode='a',
    format='%(asctime)s,%(msecs)d %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s',
    datefmt='%H:%M:%S',
    level=logging.DEBUG
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

app = FastAPI()

# Instrument FastAPI
FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    logger.info("Root endpoint accessed")
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    logger.info(f"Item details requested for item_id: {item_id}")
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```


Run your FastAPI application:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Your API is now up and running, ready to log and trace every request!

### Step 5: Testing and Analyzing

*Let’s put everything to the test!*

Test Your API:

1. Use a browser or curl to test the endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
curl http://localhost:8000/items/45
```
2. Check the Logs & Traces in OpenObserve:

Head over to http://localhost:5080 and explore your logs. You can filter, search, and dive deep into the data to see how your application is performing.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Common Configuration Mistakes

**Misconfigured Logging**

Setting up OpenTelemetry logging can often present challenges, particularly when it comes to ensuring that all components are correctly configured. In our architecture, it is crucial to ensure that the config.yaml file is properly structured and that all necessary receiver, processor, and exporter components are configured accurately.

### Best Practices

To avoid configuration issues, consider the following best practices:

- **Double-check Configuration**: Always review your `config.yaml` for accuracy, ensuring that all paths, endpoints, and tokens are correct.
- **Use Environment Variables**: For sensitive information like authentication tokens, consider using environment variables to keep your configuration secure and flexible.

If you encounter issues with logs not being ingested or exported, double-check your configuration and consult the [OpenTelemetry Discussions forum](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/discussions) for help and insights from the community.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

*Observability? Check!*
