Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that helps manage complex applications in a scalable way. However, gaining real-time visibility into the logs of these applications can be challenging. Integrating Kubernetes with OpenObserve, a flexible, high-performance log and metrics analysis tool, allows DevOps teams to streamline log collection and analysis. This integration provides real-time insights, crucial for identifying issues quickly and ensuring system reliability.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up real-time Kubernetes log streaming to OpenObserve using Helm and OpenTelemetry.

## Key Takeaways

* Learn how to set up real-time Kubernetes log streaming to OpenObserve  
* Understand the role of Helm and OpenTelemetry in the integration process  
* Discover the benefits of real-time log analysis for DevOps teams  
* Compare OpenTelemetry Operator and OpenTelemetry Collector for observability  
* Gain insights into optimizing Kubernetes monitoring and troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before proceeding:

* Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, GKE, EKS)  
* Helm 3.x installed on your local machine  
* kubectl configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster  
* Internet connectivity to fetch required components

### Step 1: Install Cert-Manager

Cert-Manager is a tool to automate the management of TLS certificates within Kubernetes. We need it for securing communication between components:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

Cert-Manager will handle the certificates and ensure secure connections between services.

### Step 2: Add the OpenObserve Helm Repository

Add the OpenObserve Helm repository to make the OpenObserve components available for installation

```
helm repo add openobserve https://charts.openobserve.ai
```

Helm makes it easy to deploy and manage OpenObserve components in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 3: Apply Prometheus Operator CRDs

The Prometheus Operator manages Kubernetes monitoring components like ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors. Apply these CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) to enable Kubernetes-native metrics collection:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_podmonitors.yaml
```

This step is essential for monitoring pods and services and pushing their metrics to OpenObserve.

### Step 4: Deploy the OpenTelemetry Operator

OpenTelemetry Operator is an open-source observability tool designed to collect, process, and export metrics and logs from Kubernetes:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

The OpenTelemetry Operator will be responsible for collecting telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) from your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 5: Create Namespace for OpenObserve Collector

To isolate the OpenObserve collector deployment, create a separate namespace

```
kubectl create ns openobserve-collector
```

This step helps organize resources and manage permissions more effectively.

### Step 6: Deploy OpenObserve Collector with Helm

Now, we will install the OpenObserve collector using Helm:

```
helm --namespace openobserve-collector \
  install o2c openobserve/openobserve-collector \
  --set exporters."otlphttp/openobserve".endpoint=http://localhost:5080/api/default  \
  --set exporters."otlphttp/openobserve".headers.Authorization="Basic <auth_token>"  \
  --set exporters."otlphttp/openobserve_k8s_events".endpoint=http://localhost:5080/api/default  \
  --set exporters."otlphttp/openobserve_k8s_events".headers.Authorization="Basic <auth_token>"
```

This command configures the OpenObserve collector to use the **OTLP HTTP exporter** to send logs and Kubernetes events directly to the specified OpenObserve endpoint. Ensure the provided authorization token is secure and base64-encoded.

### Step 7: Verify the Setup

Once the installation is complete, check if the pods are running successfully:

```
kubectl get pods -n openobserve-collector
```

You should see OpenObserve Collector pods in the **Running** state. If not, inspect the logs to diagnose issues

```
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n openobserve-collector
```

### Step 8: Access OpenObserve Dashboard

With the logs and metrics now streaming to OpenObserve, open the OpenObserve dashboard to start analyzing Kubernetes logs in real time. Use filters and search queries to troubleshoot issues, monitor system health, and identify performance bottlenecks.
